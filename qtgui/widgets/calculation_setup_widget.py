Deprecated stub placeholder. Do NOT import CalculationSetupPage from here.

This module previously provided an embeddable wrapper around
`CalculationSetupPage`. The workflow tabs now use a lightweight
`CalculationHeaderWidget` instead. Keep this file as a benign stub
to avoid accidental heavy imports in other modules.
